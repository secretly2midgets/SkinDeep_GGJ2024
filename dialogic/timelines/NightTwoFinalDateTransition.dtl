Narrator: Your stomach churns trying to handle the food that you are shovelling in. When you finally realize it wonâ€™t settle, you run to the balcony.

Narrator: You hastily grab as many napkins as possible and clean yourself up. You throw them out just in time to watch your date come up the stairs.
